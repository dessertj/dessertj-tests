= dessert dependencies tests

This module compares the dependencies determined by _dessertj-core_
with those found by the `jdeps` tool which is part of the JDK.
Therefore this module has a lot of test dependencies.

For each class within the test dependencies _dessertj-core_ determines
all class dependencies `jdeps` finds. For some corner cases the
reverse is not true.
